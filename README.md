`posthdf` is a [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) module
that posts scalars, macros and matrices in `e()`
using estimation results stored in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) files.

## Why `posthdf`?
Tools for reading/writing HDF5 files are widely available across platforms.
By simplifying the process of loading estimation results into Stata,
this module eases the joint use of multiple statistical packages
in the stage of reporting and visualization.
One can conveniently take advantage of the excellent tools
such as [`estout`](http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/estout/index.html)
and [`coefplot`](http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/coefplot/index.html) in Stata,
even though the estimation process is done somewhere else.
With all the results collected in one place,
it is easier to maintain a consistent formatting style
and streamlines the editing process.

## Installation
The latest release is on the `stable` branch of this repository
and can be obtained by running the following command in Stata:

    net install posthdf, replace from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junyuan-chen/posthdf/stable/)

The `master` branch contains the latest development
that might have not been tagged for release.

**Note:**
To check the version of the current installation of `posthdf`,
run `which posthdf` in Stata.

Since the functionality relies on Python integration introduced in Stata 16,
a Python installation is required (Python version 3.7 or above is recommended)
and it needs to be linked to Stata with
[`python set exec`](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?python).

The following Python packages are required:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/)

If you do not already have a Python installation,
a simple way to set up the Python environment
is to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),
which provides Python and a package manager called
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/).

## Usage
Once estimation results are saved in an HDF5 file,
posting them in Stata is very simple with `posthdf`.

#### Saving estimation results in an HDF5 file
An HDF5 file consists of `groups` and `datasets`.
Each collection of estimation results should be saved
in the same HDF5 group with each item being an HDF5 dataset named appropriately.

- An HDF5 group is just like a folder.
Results saved in the same group
will be posted in the same collection in Stata
as if they were generated from an e-class command.
The group name will also be used to save the results
through [`estimates store`](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?estimates).

- An HDF5 dataset holds the data as an array.
Each object such as the coefficient vector,
the variance-covariance matrix,
the number of observations, etc.,
should be saved separately in its own HDF5 dataset.
The name of each dataset will be used
when the object is posted as `e(name)` in Stata.

- Certain objects provide special information for
[`ereturn post`](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?ereturn).
It is best to name the datasets containing these objects
using the default values listed in the help file (`help posthdf`)
so that no further specification is needed to inform their locations.

#### Posting the estimation results in Stata
To post all the groups of estimation results in Stata, simply run

    posthdf using file_name

Each group of results are now saved under the group name (with any `/` replaced by `_`).

Note that `posthdf` also provides the following features:

- If an array of coefficient names are found,
they will be used to specify the column names and row names
for coefficient vector `b` and variance-covariance matrix `V`.

- If the coefficient names indicate
levels and interactions for [`factor variables`](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?fvvarlist)
and [`time-series operators`](https://www.stata.com/help.cgi?tsvarlist)
such as leads and lags,
they can be converted into a format that Stata understands
using a parser specified by option `parser`.
Users can provide their own parsers if desired.
